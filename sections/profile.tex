    I graduated in TADS (Technology and Analysis in System Development) from Univel in 2008 and since then I have been working in the area of equipment, 
    server, and network maintenance, as well as user support. This role gave me access to Delphi system development. 
    In 2008, I took on the role of programmer and worked on ERP system development for poultry and swine refrigerators, as well as for the agribusiness area.\\

    From the beginning of my career, I have a affinity for the Linux operating system, which allowed me to learn more about datacenters. 
    In 2016, I had the opportunity to take on the DevOps role, where I led the implementation and automation of the pipeline, 
    as well as developed tools and scripts that are still used by the company. Since August 2019, I also lead the infrastructure team at Ecocentauro, 
    responsible for the physical restructuring of the new administrative headquarters, datacenter maintenance, internal network, and cloud.\\

    During the pandemic, I was responsible for the structure that allowed for the continuation of work from home for all employees, 
    without compromising the work scheme. Over the course of nearly 20 years in the profession, I have had the opportunity to work with various languages and technologies, 
    including Python, Golang, Dart, Containers, Bacula, VMWare ESXI, GitLab, AWS, and Kong.\\

    I enjoy the challenge my area provides, allowing me to improve the team's productive process, solve complex problems, 
    and anticipate possible situations that may affect the smooth operation of the company's work.
